Berkeley modeling group meeting 3/23/20

- Primary modeling question: what do we do to get out of the current situation?
	- How do we get out of shelter in place without returning to outbreak dynamics?
- Tallying results of the US failure to respond earlier to the outbreak
	- Needs better data, probably need a postmortem approach
- Cohort in GA of ~100 basic trainees that had weekly PCR assays
	- Simple natural immunity based modeling
	- Presence of antibodies to other CoVs leads to more lung damage?
- Vaccine product characteristics:
	- Efficacious against shedding? Severe illness?
		- Given that should it be targeted to younger groups, older age groups?
	- Similar questions with Remdesivir -> doesn't seem to work well with late stage disease, needs earlier intervention
	- Prophylactic effects vs transmission reduction approaches
	- 0-100% efficacy against shedding vs 0-100% efficacy against illness
	- "What is required in terms of a vaccination to aid SARS-CoV2 interventions"
- Justin:
	- Continued costs in delay to implement more intense restrictions
		- Especially in nations more vulnerable to rapid spread
	- How do we start bringing people back into the workforce with antibody screening, etc.
	- Timeliness questions regarding vaccine rollout
		- Averted morbidity and mortality associated with timing of vaccine rollout
- FluTE H1N1 paper Plos CompBio publicly available https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000656
- Local Bay Area help
	- CA doing well at releasing testing data, need high quality estimates of the scope of the outbreak
		- How big is it now, how big was it dating all the way back to January?
			- Crosstabs of hospitalization rates, death rates, symptomatic rates
- Jen: Dynamics associated with school closures and based on where kids end up
- Graham: Seasonality?
- Sean: Implementation of models
	- IDmod's software http://www.idmod.org/docs/cms/
	- Complications like non-exponentially distributed lags and such
	- C++ and R code base Sean is working on that may be ready in 4-7 days
		- Continuous time discrete state model with non-exponentially distributed delays
		- Graham fitting distributions of latent periods, can be done explicitly
		- Could have spatial structure, could be at household level and built in metapopulation dynamics
		- Community and household transmission dynamics (separate FOI for each)
		- Contact structure:

			- https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1008895108
Data: 
	- Variation in testing efforts
	- Covid tracking project (quality of testing, negatives, positives, hospitalizations, deaths, etc.)
	- Some of the modeling questions can go without super detailed modeling questions
	- Need solid distributions of same natural history parameters
		- Incubation period
		- Duration of shedding (don't have clear estimates yet)
		- Clinical spectrum from Diamond princess
			- Where do people end up from positive to resolved
		- Duration of latent period between infection and symptoms/shedding
		- Time from symptoms onset to hospitalization OR time from exposure to symptoms onset
			- Maybe available from Kaiser soon, probably available from China
	- Github/Slack channels to share data, ideas, code, etc.
	
Projects recap:
	- Impacts/strategies for lifting social distancing policy
	- Allocation of vaccine/antivirals to mitigate morbidity/mortality/transmission
	- Working backwards from testing data to get epidemic size through time
	- Impact of school closures, where kids end up (daycares, at home, with grandparents)
	- Determinants of second-wave transmission
